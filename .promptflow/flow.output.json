    "romptflow/docs/concepts/index.md content: # Concepts\nIn this section, you will learn the basic concepts of prompt flow .\n:maxdepth: 1  \nconcept-flows  \nconcept-tools  \nconcept-connections  \nconcept-variants  \ndesign-principles  \nfilepath: promptflow/docs/concepts/concept-flows.md content: While how LLMs work may be elusive to many developers, how LLM apps work is not - they essentially involve a series\nof calls to external services such as LLMs/databases/search engines, or intermediate data processing, all glued together . Thus LLM apps are merely Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)\nof function calls. These DAGs are flows in prompt flow .\nFlows\nA flow in prompt flow is a DAG of functions (we call them tools  (./concept-tools.md) ). These functions/tools connected via input/output dependencies and executed based on the\ntopology by prompt flow executor .\nA flow is represented as a Y AML file and can be visualized with our Prompt flow for VS Code extension  (https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=prompt-"
